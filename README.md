# WorkLifeBalance_TheGuide
This app is a guide to a board game, Work. Life. Balance. made as a University Project.
This app allows players of the game to have a digital copy of the intructions of the game and to have a digital score card of their persona.

The motivation behind this app is to give the user more ease of use when playing the board game. It allows the user to refresh on instructions rules that they so wish to.
The user can use the app to keep track of their score digitally if they cannot do so physically on the game.

This is a first iteration of the app and there are elements to improve on.
